# A modern approach to VDI

This repository holds the slides and the demo code for a talk given at HEIA-FR on May 19th, 2022

Description:

> The concept of VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) has been around for quite some time, but it has seen a renewed interest due to the shift to a remote or hybrid working environment.
Discover how embracing VDI could help your transition to remote work while maintaining security expectations. Leverage modern virtualization technologies to set up a fully functional development environment in the cloud in less time it takes to make a coffee, using OpenStack, Terraform and Visual Studio Code Remote Extensions.
