### (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure)

_Set of technologies providing access to remote computers_

- An old idea ("Citrix" does it for > 20 years)
- Recently revisited
  - thanks to technology improvements
  - due to an infamous event...

## Benefits

1. Access from anywhere
    - Perfect for WFH

2. Security
    - No confidential files/code on laptops
    - Isolated environments
    - Especially for developers (admin/sudo ?)

---

## Benefits

3. Easier IT Management
    - Easier to manage and patch

4. Happier developers
    - Access to a Linux environment
    - Performance boost from server hardware
    - Messed up your environment ? Simply rebuild!

## Disadvantages

#### Latency is your enemy!

---

## Disadvantages

1. Network requirements
    - Latency and bandwidth (client & server !)

2. Single point of failure
    - Laptops become useless without acess to VDI


---

## Disadvantages

3. Requires dedicated staff
    - Self hosted: IT support and buy-in
    - Cloud: somebody still needs to setup and maintain

4. Harder to access to local hardware
    - USB, Serial, ...

---



## Options

1. Commercial provider
    - VMware, Citrix, ...

2. On-premise
    - OpenStack

3. Cloud
    - Your favorite provider

workflow overview

Create VM -> Setup environment -> install tools from cloud-init

Questions:
- who is familiar with OpenStack or has used it ?
- who is faimiliar with terraform and used it ?
